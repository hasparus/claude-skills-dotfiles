# Referral & Affiliate Programs

## Referral vs Affiliate

| | Referral | Affiliate |
|---|---------|-----------|
| Who | Existing customers | May not be customers |
| Best for | Natural word-of-mouth, lower-ticket/self-serve | Reaching new audiences, content creators, higher-ticket |
| Rewards | One-time or limited | Ongoing commission |
| Trust/Volume | Higher trust, lower volume | Variable trust, higher volume |

## Referral Loop Design

```
Trigger Moment → Share Action → Convert Referred → Reward → (Loop)
```

### 1. Trigger Moments (high-intent)
- Right after "aha" moment
- After achieving a milestone
- After exceptional support
- After renewing/upgrading

### 2. Share Mechanisms (ranked by effectiveness)
1. In-product sharing (highest)
2. Personalized link
3. Email invitation
4. Social sharing
5. Referral code (works offline)

### 3. Incentive Structures
- **Single-sided** (referrer only) — simpler, good for high-value products
- **Double-sided** (both parties) — higher conversion, win-win
- **Tiered** — gamifies, increases engagement

## Optimization

**Low referral rate:** ask at better moments, simplify sharing, test incentives, make prominent
**Low conversion:** improve referred user landing, strengthen new-user incentive, show referrer endorsement

### A/B Tests
- Incentive: amount, type, single vs double-sided, timing
- Messaging: program description, CTA, landing copy
- Placement: where/when prompt appears

### Common Problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Low awareness | Prominent in-app prompts |
| Low share rate | Simplify to one click |
| Low conversion | Optimize referred user experience |
| Fraud/abuse | Verification + limits |
| One-time referrers | Tiered/gamified rewards |

## Measuring Success

**Program health:** active referrers (last 30d), referral conversion rate, rewards earned/paid
**Business impact:** % new customers from referrals, referral CAC vs other channels, referred LTV, program ROI

**Typical findings:** referred customers have 16-25% higher LTV, 18-37% lower churn, refer others at 2-3x rate

## Launch Checklist

**Before:** goals + metrics, incentive structure, build/configure tool, landing page, tracking/attribution, fraud prevention, T&C, test full flow
**Launch:** announce to customers, add in-app prompts, update website, brief support team
**Post-launch (30d):** review funnel, identify top referrers, gather feedback, fix friction, reminder emails to non-referrers
