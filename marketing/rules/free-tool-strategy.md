# Free Tool Strategy (Engineering as Marketing)

## Core Principles

1. **Solve a real problem** — genuine value, useful without your main product
2. **Adjacent to core product** — natural path from tool to product, educates on problem you solve
3. **Simple and focused** — one thing well, low friction, immediate value
4. **Worth the investment** — lead value x expected leads > build cost + maintenance

## Tool Types

| Type | Examples | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Calculators | ROI, savings, pricing estimators | Decisions involving numbers |
| Generators | Templates, policies, names | Creating something quickly |
| Analyzers | Website graders, SEO auditors | Evaluating existing work |
| Testers | Meta tag preview, speed tests | Checking if something works |
| Libraries | Icon sets, templates, snippets | Reference material |
| Interactive | Tutorials, playgrounds, quizzes | Learning/understanding |

## Ideation Framework

Start with pain points:
1. What does your audience Google? — search query research, common questions
2. What manual processes are tedious? — spreadsheet tasks, repetitive calcs
3. What do they need before buying? — assessments, planning, comparisons
4. What info do they wish they had? — inaccessible data, benchmarks

Validate: search demand, uniqueness (10x better?), audience-buyer match, build feasibility/MVP scope

## Lead Capture Strategy

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Fully gated | Maximum capture | Lower usage |
| Partially gated | Balance | Common pattern |
| Ungated + optional | Maximum reach | Lower capture |
| Ungated entirely | Pure SEO/brand | No direct leads |

Best practices: clear value exchange ("Get your full report"), minimal friction (email only), show preview, optionally segment with one qualifying question

## SEO & Links
- Landing page keywords: "[thing] calculator", "[thing] generator", "free [tool type]"
- Supporting content: "How to [use case]", "What is [concept]"
- Free tools attract links — genuinely useful, unique, shareable

## Build vs Buy
- **Custom** — unique concept, core to brand, have dev capacity
- **No-code** (Outgrow, Involve.me, Typeform, Tally, Bubble) — speed, limited dev, testing concept
- **Embed existing** — good solution exists, white-label available, not differentiator

## MVP Scope
Do: core functionality, clear input/output, mobile works, basic email capture
Skip: account creation, saving results, advanced features, perfect design, edge cases

## Evaluation Scorecard
