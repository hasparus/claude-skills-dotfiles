# Launch Strategy

Best companies don't launch once — they launch again and again. Every feature, improvement, update is a chance to capture attention.

## The ORB Framework

Structure launch marketing across three channel types. Everything leads back to owned.

### Owned Channels
You own the channel (not the audience). No algorithms, no pay-to-play.
- Email list, blog, podcast, branded community, website/product
- Get more effective over time, compound value
- Start with 1-2: lacks content → blog; wants updates → email; engagement → community

### Rented Channels
Platforms with visibility you don't control. Algorithms shift, rules change.
- Social media, app stores, YouTube, Reddit
- Pick 1-2 where audience is active, use to drive to owned channels
- Twitter/X → threads → newsletter; LinkedIn → posts → gated content; Marketplaces → optimize listing → drive to site

### Borrowed Channels
Tap into someone else's audience.
- Guest content, collaborations, speaking, influencer partnerships
- List industry leaders audience follows → pitch win-win collabs → set up affiliate/referral incentives
- Convert borrowed attention into owned relationships

## Five-Phase Launch

### Phase 1: Internal
- Recruit early users one-on-one for free testing
- Collect feedback on usability gaps/missing features
- Goal: validate core functionality with friendly users

### Phase 2: Alpha
- Landing page with early access signup
- Announce product exists, invite users individually
- Goal: first external validation, initial waitlist

### Phase 3: Beta
- Work through early access list (some free, some paid)
- Teasers about problems you solve
- Recruit friends/investors/influencers to test and share
- Consider: coming soon page, "Beta" badge, email invites, feature toggles

### Phase 4: Early Access
- Leak details: screenshots, GIFs, demos
- Gather quant usage data + qual feedback
- Run user research, optionally PMF survey
- Expansion: throttle invites (5-10% batches) or invite all under "early access"

### Phase 5: Full Launch
- Open self-serve signups, start charging
- Announce GA across all channels
- Touchpoints: customer emails, in-app popups, website banner, blog post, social, Product Hunt/BetaList/HN

## Product Hunt Strategy

**Pros:** early adopter exposure, credibility, PR/backlinks
**Cons:** competitive, short-lived spikes, needs prep

**Before:** build relationships with supporters/communities, optimize listing (tagline, visuals, demo video), study successful launches, engage in communities first
**Day of:** all-day event, respond to every comment, spark discussions, direct traffic to site
**After:** follow up with engagers, convert traffic to email, continue with post-launch content

## Post-Launch Actions

- **Educate** — automated onboarding email sequence
- **Reinforce** — include in roundup emails
- **Differentiate** — publish comparison pages
- **Update** — add sections about new feature across site
- **Demo** — create interactive demo (Navattic etc.)

## Ongoing Launch Strategy

Prioritize what to announce:
- **Major** (new features, overhauls) → full campaign, blog, email, in-app, social
- **Medium** (integrations, UI enhancements) → targeted: email segments, in-app banner
- **Minor** (bug fixes, tweaks) → changelog/release notes

Space out releases. Reuse high-performing tactics. Signal active development — builds retention and word-of-mouth.
