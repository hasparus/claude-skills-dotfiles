# Popup CRO

## Core Principles

- **Timing is everything** - too early = annoying, too late = missed, right time = helpful
- **Value must be obvious** - clear immediate benefit, relevant to page context, worth the interruption
- **Respect the user** - easy to dismiss, don't trap/trick, remember preferences

## Trigger Strategies

| Trigger | When | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| Time-based | 30-60s (not 5s) | General site visitors |
| Scroll-based | 25-50% depth | Blog posts, long-form content |
| Exit intent | Cursor moving to close/leave | E-commerce, lead gen |
| Click-triggered | User clicks button/link | Lead magnets, gated content, demos |
| Page count | After X pages | Multi-page research journeys |
| Behavior-based | Cart abandon, pricing visit, repeat visits | High-intent segments |

Mobile exit alternative: back button or scroll up

## Popup Types

- **Email capture** - benefit headline (not "Subscribe"), specific value, email-only field, consider incentive
- **Lead magnet** - show what they get (cover/preview), specific tangible promise, email + maybe name
- **Discount/promotion** - clear discount amount, deadline urgency, single use per visitor, easy code apply
- **Exit intent** - acknowledge leaving, different offer than entry popup, address objections, final compelling reason. Formats: "Wait! Before you go...", "Forget something?", "Get 10% off", "Questions? Chat with us"
- **Announcement banner** - top of page, single clear message, dismissable, links to more, time-limited
- **Slide-in** - enters from corner/bottom, doesn't block content, easy dismiss/minimize, good for chat/support/secondary CTAs

## Design Best Practices

**Visual hierarchy:** 1) headline 2) value prop/offer 3) form/CTA 4) close option

**Sizing:** desktop 400-600px wide, don't cover entire screen. Mobile: full-width bottom or center, not full-screen

**Close button:** always visible top-right, large enough for mobile tap, "No thanks" text link alt, click outside to close

**Mobile:** no exit intent (use alternatives), bottom slide-ups > full-screen overlays, larger touch targets, easy dismiss gestures

## Copy Formulas

**Headlines:**
- Benefit: "Get [result] in [timeframe]"
- Question: "Want [desired outcome]?"
- Command: "Don't miss [thing]"
- Social proof: "Join [X] people who..."
- Curiosity: "The one thing [audience] always get wrong about [topic]"

**Subheadlines:** expand promise, address objection ("No spam, ever"), set expectations ("Weekly tips in 5 min")

**CTA buttons:** first person ("Get My Discount" > "Get Your Discount"), specific > generic ("Send Me the Guide" > "Submit"), value-focused ("Claim My 10% Off" > "Subscribe")

**Decline options:** polite - "No thanks" / "Maybe later" / "I'm not interested". Avoid manipulative guilt-trips

## Frequency & Rules

- Max once per session, remember dismissals (cookie/localStorage), 7-30 days before re-showing
- Target: new vs returning, by traffic source, by page type
- Exclude: converted users, recently dismissed, checkout/conversion flows
- Match offer to page context

## Compliance

- **GDPR:** clear consent, privacy policy link, no pre-checked opt-ins, honor unsubscribe
- **Accessibility:** keyboard nav (Tab/Enter/Esc), focus trap, screen reader compatible, sufficient contrast
- **Google:** intrusive interstitials hurt SEO (especially mobile). OK: cookie notices, age verification, reasonable banners. Avoid: full-screen before content on mobile

## Common Strategies by Business Type

- **E-commerce:** entry/scroll discount -> exit intent bigger discount -> cart abandonment reminder
- **B2B SaaS:** click-triggered demo/lead magnets -> scroll newsletter -> exit intent trial/content
- **Content/media:** scroll-based newsletter -> page count subscribe -> exit intent future content
- **Lead gen:** time-delayed list building -> click-triggered lead magnets -> exit intent final capture

## Experiment Ideas

**Format** - center modal vs slide-in, full-screen vs smaller modal, bottom bar vs corner, sticky banner vs static, with/without countdown timer

**Triggers** - exit intent vs 30s delay vs 50% scroll, optimal time delay (10/30/60s), scroll depth (25/50/75%), page count trigger, behavior-based triggers, return vs new visitor targeting, referral source targeting

**Messaging** - attention-grabbing vs informational headlines, urgency vs value copy, headline length/specificity, CTA text variations, button color, primary+secondary vs single CTA, decline text tone, with/without images, product preview vs generic, social proof in popup

**Personalization** - popup based on visitor data, industry-specific content, content based on pages visited, progressive profiling

**Frequency** - once per session vs once per week, cool-down after dismissal, escalating offers over visits
