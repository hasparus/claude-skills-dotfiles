# Page CRO

## CRO Analysis Framework (by impact)

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity
- Visitor understands what + why in 5 seconds?
- Benefit-focused, not feature-focused
- Customer language, not jargon
- One main thing, not everything

### 2. Headline Effectiveness
- Communicates core value prop
- Specific enough to be meaningful
- Matches traffic source messaging
- Patterns: "Get [outcome] without [pain]", numbers/timeframes, "Join X+ teams..."

### 3. CTA Placement, Copy, Hierarchy
- One clear primary action, visible above fold
- Copy = value, not action: "Start Free Trial" > "Submit"
- Repeated at key decision points
- Primary vs secondary structure

### 4. Visual Hierarchy & Scannability
- Main message scannable? Key elements prominent?
- Enough whitespace? Images support or distract?

### 5. Trust Signals & Social Proof
- Logos, testimonials (specific + attributed), case study numbers, review scores, security badges
- Place near CTAs and after benefit claims

### 6. Objection Handling
- Price/value, "will this work for me?", implementation difficulty, "what if it doesn't work?"
- Address via: FAQ, guarantees, comparisons, process transparency

### 7. Friction Points
- Too many fields, unclear next steps, confusing nav, unnecessary requirements, mobile issues, slow loads

## Output Format

- **Quick Wins** - easy changes, immediate impact
- **High-Impact Changes** - bigger effort, significant improvement
- **Test Ideas** - hypotheses to A/B test
- **Copy Alternatives** - 2-3 options for headlines/CTAs with rationale

## Page-Specific Frameworks

- **Homepage** - clear positioning for cold visitors, path for ready-to-buy + still-researching
- **Landing Page** - message match with traffic source, single CTA, remove nav, complete argument on one page
- **Pricing Page** - clear plan comparison, recommended plan, address "which plan?" anxiety
- **Feature Page** - connect feature to benefit, use cases, clear path to try/buy
- **Blog Post** - contextual CTAs matching topic, inline CTAs at natural stops

## Experiments

Test: hero section, trust signal placement, pricing presentation, form optimization, nav/UX
