# Content Strategy

## Searchable vs Shareable

Every piece must be searchable, shareable, or both. Prioritize search -- it captures existing demand.

**Searchable** -- target specific keyword/question, match search intent exactly, clear titles matching queries, headings mirroring search patterns, keywords in title/headings/first paragraph/URL, comprehensive coverage, optimize for AI/LLM discovery.

**Shareable** -- novel insight or original data, challenge conventional wisdom, stories that make people feel, content people share to look smart, connect to trends, vulnerable honest experiences.

## Content Types

### Searchable
- **Use-case content** -- [persona] + [use-case], targets long-tail: "Project management for designers"
- **Hub & spoke** -- hub = comprehensive overview, spokes = subtopics. Interlink strategically. Most content works fine under `/blog`; dedicated hub structures only for major topics with layered depth.
- **Template libraries** -- high-intent keywords + product adoption. Provide standalone value, show how product enhances it.

### Shareable
- **Thought leadership** -- articulate what everyone feels but hasn't named, challenge wisdom with evidence
- **Data-driven** -- product data (anonymized), public data analysis, original research
- **Expert roundups** -- 15-30 experts, one question. Built-in distribution.
- **Case studies** -- challenge -> solution -> results -> learnings
- **Meta content** -- behind-the-scenes transparency: "How We Got First $5k MRR"

## Content Pillars

3-5 core topics your brand will own. Each spawns a cluster.

**How to identify:**
1. Product-led -- what problems does your product solve?
2. Audience-led -- what does your ICP need to learn?
3. Search-led -- what topics have volume?
4. Competitor-led -- what are competitors ranking for?

**Good pillars:** align with product, match audience interests, have search volume or social interest, broad enough for many subtopics.

## Keyword Research by Buyer Stage

| Stage | Modifiers | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Awareness | what is, how to, guide to | "What is Agile Project Management" |
| Consideration | best, vs, alternatives, comparison | "Asana vs Trello vs Monday" |
| Decision | pricing, reviews, demo, trial | "PM Tool Pricing Comparison" |
| Implementation | templates, tutorial, how to use, setup | "Step-by-Step Setup Tutorial" |

## Ideation Sources

1. **Keyword data** (Ahrefs, SEMrush, GSC) -- cluster topics, map buyer stage, find quick wins (low competition + decent volume + high relevance), identify content gaps
2. **Call transcripts** -- questions -> FAQ/posts, pain points in customer words, objections -> proactive content, competitor mentions
3. **Survey responses** -- open-ended themes, 30%+ mention = high priority, resource requests, format preferences
4. **Forums** -- `site:reddit.com [topic]`, `site:quora.com [topic]`, Indie Hackers, HN, Product Hunt. Extract: FAQs, misconceptions, debates, terminology.
5. **Competitor analysis** -- `site:competitor.com/blog`, top-performing posts, gaps, case studies, content structure. Find topics you can cover better, angles they miss, outdated content.
6. **Sales & support** -- common objections, repeated questions, ticket patterns, success stories, feature requests and underlying problems

## Prioritization

Score each idea on four factors:

| Factor | Weight | Questions |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Customer Impact | 40% | How frequently raised? What % face this? How emotional? LTV of customers with this need? |
| Content-Market Fit | 30% | Aligns with product? Unique insights from research? Customer stories? Leads to product interest? |
| Search Potential | 20% | Volume? Competition? Long-tail opportunities? Growing or declining? |
| Resources | 10% | Have expertise? Research needed? Assets needed? |

## Output Format

1. **Content pillars** -- 3-5 with rationale, subtopic clusters, connection to product
2. **Priority topics** -- topic/title, searchable/shareable/both, content type, target keyword + buyer stage, why (customer research backing)
3. **Topic cluster map** -- visual/structured representation of content interconnections
