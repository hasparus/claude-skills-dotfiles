# Copy Editing

Don't rewrite -- enhance. Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review. Each edit needs a clear reason. Preserve author's voice.

## The Seven Sweeps

Edit through seven sequential passes. After each sweep, re-check previous sweeps aren't compromised.

### 1. Clarity
Can the reader understand? Check: confusing structures, unclear pronouns, jargon, ambiguity, missing context.

Clarity killers: sentences saying too much, abstract instead of concrete, assuming reader knowledge, burying the point.

After: confirm one main idea per section, copy speaks to reader.

### 2. Voice & Tone
Is it consistent? Check: formal/casual shifts, inconsistent brand personality, jarring mood changes, random technical language.

Common: starts casual then goes corporate, mixing "we"/"the company," humor appearing inconsistently.

### 3. So What
Does every claim answer "why should I care?" Check: features without benefits, claims without consequences, missing "which means..." bridges.

- Bad: "Our platform uses AI-powered analytics"
- Good: "AI-powered analytics surface insights you'd miss manually -- better decisions in half the time"

### 4. Prove It
Is every claim supported? Check: unsubstantiated claims, missing social proof, "best"/"leading" without evidence.

Proof types: named testimonials, case studies, statistics, third-party validation, guarantees, logos, review scores.

Flags: "Trusted by thousands" (which?), "Industry-leading" (says who?), "Customers love us" (show them).

### 5. Specificity
Concrete enough to compel? Check: vague language ("improve," "enhance"), generic statements, round numbers, missing details.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| Save time | Save 4 hours/week |
| Many customers | 2,847 teams |
| Fast results | Results in 14 days |
| Great support | Response within 2 hours |

### 6. Heightened Emotion
Does copy make reader feel something? Check: flat informational language, pain points mentioned but not felt, aspirations stated but not evoked.

Techniques: paint vivid "before" state, sensory language, micro-stories, shared experiences, reflective questions.

### 7. Zero Risk
Every barrier to action removed? Check: friction near CTAs, unanswered objections, missing trust signals, unclear next steps, hidden costs.

Reducers: money-back guarantee, free trial, no credit card required, cancel anytime, social proof near CTA, clear expectations, privacy assurance.

## Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|

| Corporate Speak | "Leverage synergies" | Ask "How would a human say this?" |
| Weak Opening | Starts with company history | Lead with reader's problem/outcome |
| Buried CTA | Ask comes after too much buildup | Make CTA obvious, early, repeated |
| No Proof | "Customers love us" -- no evidence | Add testimonials, numbers, cases |
| Generic Claims | "We help businesses grow" | Specify who, how, how much |
| Mixed Audiences | Speaks to everyone, resonates with none | Pick one audience, write to them |
| Feature Overload | Lists every capability | Focus on 3-5 key benefits |
