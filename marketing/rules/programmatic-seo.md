# Programmatic SEO

## Core Principles

1. **Unique value per page** — not just swapped variables; maximize differentiation
2. **Proprietary data wins** — hierarchy: proprietary > product-derived > user-generated > licensed > public
3. **Subfolders, not subdomains** — `yoursite.com/templates/resume/` not `templates.yoursite.com/resume/`
4. **Match search intent** — pages must answer what people search for
5. **Quality over quantity** — 100 great pages > 10,000 thin ones
6. **Avoid penalties** — no doorway pages, keyword stuffing, duplicate content

## The 12 Playbooks

| Playbook | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Templates | "[type] template" | "resume template" |
| Curation | "best [category]" | "best website builders" |
| Conversions | "[X] to [Y]" | "$10 USD to GBP" |
| Comparisons | "[X] vs [Y]" | "webflow vs wordpress" |
| Examples | "[type] examples" | "landing page examples" |
| Locations | "[service] in [location]" | "dentists in austin" |
| Personas | "[product] for [audience]" | "crm for real estate" |
| Integrations | "[A] [B] integration" | "slack asana integration" |
| Glossary | "what is [term]" | "what is pSEO" |
| Translations | multilingual content | localized content |
| Directory | "[category] tools" | "ai copywriting tools" |
| Profiles | "[entity name]" | "stripe ceo" |

Playbooks can layer — e.g., "Best coworking spaces in San Diego".

## Implementation Framework

1. **Keyword pattern research** — identify repeating structure, variables, unique combos; validate aggregate volume, distribution, trend
2. **Data requirements** — sources (first-party/scraped/licensed/public), update cadence
3. **Template design** — header w/ target keyword, unique intro, data-driven sections, related pages, intent-appropriate CTAs; conditional content, original insights per page
4. **Internal linking** — hub-and-spoke model, cross-links between spokes, no orphans, XML sitemap, breadcrumbs w/ structured data
5. **Indexation strategy** — prioritize high-volume patterns, noindex thin variations, manage crawl budget, separate sitemaps by type

## Quality Checks

**Pre-launch:**
- [ ] Each page provides unique value and answers intent
- [ ] Unique titles + meta descriptions
- [ ] Proper heading structure + schema markup
- [ ] Page speed acceptable
- [ ] Connected to site architecture, related pages linked
- [ ] In XML sitemap, crawlable, no conflicting noindex

**Post-launch — track:** indexation rate, rankings, traffic, engagement, conversion
**Watch for:** thin content warnings, ranking drops, manual actions, crawl errors

**Common mistakes:** just swapping city names, keyword cannibalization, pages with no demand, poor data quality, pages for Google not users
