# Copywriting

## Principles

- **Clarity > cleverness** -- if forced to choose, choose clear
- **Benefits > features** -- what it means for the customer, not what it does
- **Specificity > vagueness** -- "Cut weekly reporting from 4h to 15min" not "Save time"
- **Customer language > company language** -- mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, support, interviews
- **One idea per section** -- build logical flow down the page

## Writing Style

1. Simple > complex -- "use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate"
2. Specific > vague -- avoid "streamline," "optimize," "innovative"
3. Active > passive -- "We generate reports" not "Reports are generated"
4. Confident > qualified -- cut "almost," "very," "really"
5. Show > tell -- describe outcome, skip adverbs
6. Honest > sensational -- never fabricate stats or testimonials

**Quality check:** Jargon confusing outsiders? Sentences doing too much? Passive voice? Exclamation points? Buzzwords without substance?

## Best Practices

- **Be direct** -- don't bury value in qualifications
- **Rhetorical questions** -- engage readers: "Tired of chasing approvals?"
- **Analogies** -- make abstract concrete
- **Humor** -- only if it fits brand and doesn't undermine clarity

## Page Structure

### Above the Fold

**Headline** -- single most important message, specific > generic

Formulas:
- "{Outcome} without {pain point}"
- "The {category} for {audience}"
- "Never {unpleasant event} again"
- "{Question highlighting main pain}"

**Subheadline** -- expands headline, adds specificity, 1-2 sentences max

**Primary CTA** -- action-oriented, communicate what they get: "Start Free Trial" > "Sign Up"

See [references/copy-frameworks.md](references/copy-frameworks.md) for headline formulas and section templates.
See [references/natural-transitions.md](references/natural-transitions.md) for transition phrases.

### Core Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Social Proof | Credibility -- logos, stats, testimonials |
| Problem/Pain | Show you understand their situation |
| Solution/Benefits | Connect to outcomes, 3-5 key benefits |
| How It Works | Reduce complexity, 3-4 steps |
| Objection Handling | FAQ, comparisons, guarantees |
| Final CTA | Recap value, repeat CTA, risk reversal |

## CTA Copy

**Avoid:** Submit, Sign Up, Learn More, Click Here, Get Started

**Formula:** [Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Qualifier]
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Get the Complete Checklist"
- "See Pricing for My Team"

## Page-Specific

- **Homepage** -- serve multiple audiences without being generic; lead with broadest value prop; clear paths for different intents
- **Landing page** -- single message, single CTA; match headline to traffic source; complete argument on one page
- **Pricing** -- help choose right plan; address "which is right for me?" anxiety; make recommended plan obvious
- **Feature** -- connect feature -> benefit -> outcome; show use cases; clear path to try/buy
- **About** -- story of why you exist; connect mission to customer benefit; still include CTA

## Voice and Tone

Establish before writing:
- **Formality** -- casual / professional-friendly / formal-enterprise
- **Personality** -- playful or serious? bold or understated? technical or accessible?

Headlines can be bolder. Body copy clearer. CTAs action-oriented.

## Output Format

- **Page copy** organized by section (headline, subheadline, CTA, section headers, body, secondary CTAs)
- **Annotations** on key choices -- why, what principle applies
- **Alternatives** for headlines/CTAs: 2-3 options with rationale
- **Meta content** if relevant -- page title (SEO), meta description
