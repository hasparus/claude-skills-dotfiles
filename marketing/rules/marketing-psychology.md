# Marketing Psychology & Mental Models

## Foundational Thinking

- **First Principles** - break down to basics instead of copying competitors. Ask "why" 5x
- **Jobs to Be Done** - people hire products for outcomes. Frame around the job, not features
- **Circle of Competence** - double down where you have genuine advantage. Don't chase every channel
- **Inversion** - list what guarantees failure, then prevent each
- **Occam's Razor** - check obvious causes first (broken form) before complex attribution
- **Pareto (80/20)** - find 20% of channels/customers driving 80% of results. Cut the rest
- **Local vs Global Optima** - optimizing email subjects won't help if email is the wrong channel
- **Theory of Constraints** - find the one bottleneck limiting throughput. Fix that first
- **Opportunity Cost** - time on low-ROI channel = time not on high-ROI. Compare alternatives
- **Diminishing Returns** - know when to diversify vs double down
- **Second-Order Thinking** - flash sale boosts revenue but trains customers to wait for discounts
- **Map != Territory** - your persona is useful but real customers are more complex
- **Probabilistic Thinking** - don't bet everything on one campaign. Plan for multiple outcomes
- **Barbell Strategy** - 80% proven channels, 20% experimental bets. Avoid mediocre middle

## Understanding Buyers

- **Fundamental Attribution Error** - when customers don't convert, examine process before blaming them
- **Mere Exposure Effect** - consistent brand presence builds preference. Repetition creates trust
- **Availability Heuristic** - case studies make success feel achievable. Make outcomes easy to imagine
- **Confirmation Bias** - align with existing beliefs. Fighting beliefs head-on rarely works
- **Lindy Effect** - proven principles (value props, social proof) outlast trendy tactics
- **Mimetic Desire** - show desirable people want your product. Waitlists, exclusivity trigger this
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - kill underperforming campaigns. Past spend doesn't justify future spend
- **Endowment Effect** - free trials let customers "own" the product, making them reluctant to leave
- **IKEA Effect** - let customers customize/configure. Their investment increases perceived value
- **Zero-Price Effect** - "free" is psychologically different from cheap. $1->$0 > $2->$1
- **Present Bias** - emphasize immediate benefits ("start saving today") over future ROI
- **Status-Quo Bias** - reduce friction to switch. "Import data in one click"
- **Default Effect** - pre-select the plan you want chosen. Opt-out beats opt-in
- **Paradox of Choice** - 3 pricing tiers beat 7. Recommend one "best for most"
- **Goal-Gradient Effect** - progress bars and "almost there" messaging drive completion
- **Peak-End Rule** - design memorable peaks (surprise upgrades) and strong endings (thank you pages)
- **Zeigarnik Effect** - "You're 80% done" creates pull to finish. Open loops create tension
- **Pratfall Effect** - admitting a weakness ("not the cheapest, but...") increases trust
- **Curse of Knowledge** - your product seems obvious to you but confusing to newcomers. Test copy
- **Mental Accounting** - "$3/day" feels different than "$90/month" even though it's the same
- **Regret Aversion** - money-back guarantees and "no commitment" reduce fear of regret
- **Bandwagon / Social Proof** - customer counts, testimonials, logos, reviews. Numbers create confidence

## Influencing Behavior

- **Reciprocity** - give free content/tools/tiers first. Creates obligation to give back
- **Commitment & Consistency** - get small commitments first (email signup). Each step leads to next
- **Authority Bias** - expert endorsements, certifications, "featured in" logos, thought leadership
- **Liking / Similarity** - "built by marketers for marketers" signals similarity
- **Unity Principle** - position brand as part of customer's tribe. Insider language, shared values
- **Scarcity / Urgency** - limited-time offers, low-stock warnings. Only when genuine
- **Foot-in-the-Door** - free trial -> paid -> annual -> enterprise. Each step builds on last
- **Door-in-the-Face** - show enterprise pricing first, then affordable starter plan. Contrast = deal
- **Loss Aversion** - "don't miss out" beats "you could gain." Losses feel 2x gains
- **Anchoring** - show higher price first (original, competitor, enterprise) to set expectations
- **Decoy Effect** - add inferior third option to make preferred tier the obvious choice
- **Framing Effect** - "90% success rate" vs "10% failure rate" - same fact, different perception
- **Contrast Effect** - show "before" clearly. Contrast makes improvements vivid

## Pricing Psychology

- **Charm Pricing** - $99 feels much cheaper than $100. Left digit dominates
- **Round Pricing** - $100 signals premium, $99 signals value. Match to positioning
- **Rule of 100** - under $100: "20% off" > "$16 off". Over $100: "$100 off" > "20% off"
- **Good-Better-Best** - middle tier = target. Expensive anchors, cheap provides floor
- **Mental Accounting (pricing)** - "$1/day" < "$30/month" perceptually. Reframe expense

## Design & Delivery

- **Hick's Law** - more options = slower decisions = more abandonment. One CTA beats three
- **AIDA** - Attention -> Interest -> Desire -> Action. Structure pages through each stage
- **Rule of 7** - ~7 touchpoints before converting. Build multi-touch campaigns
- **Nudge / Choice Architecture** - defaults, strategic ordering, friction reduction guide behavior
- **BJ Fogg** - Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Prompt. All three needed
- **EAST Framework** - make it Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely
- **COM-B** - Capability + Opportunity + Motivation = Behavior. Address all three
- **Activation Energy** - reduce starting friction. Pre-fill, templates, quick wins. First step trivially easy
- **North Star Metric** - one metric capturing value delivered. Align all efforts
- **Cobra Effect** - test incentive structures. Referral bonus may attract low-quality gaming

## Growth & Scaling

- **Feedback Loops** - more users -> more content -> better SEO -> more users. Strengthen positive loops
- **Compounding** - consistent content/SEO/brand compounds. Start early
- **Network Effects** - design features that improve with more users: shared workspaces, communities
- **Flywheel** - content -> traffic -> leads -> customers -> case studies -> content. Each powers next
- **Switching Costs** - increase ethically: integrations, data accumulation, workflow customization
- **Exploration vs Exploitation** - don't abandon working channels but allocate some to experiments
- **Critical Mass** - focus on one segment before expanding. Depth before breadth
- **Survivorship Bias** - study failed campaigns too. The viral hit had 99 invisible failures
