# Email Sequences

## Core Principles

1. **One email, one job** - single CTA per email
2. **Value before ask** - earn the right to sell
3. **Relevance over volume** - fewer, better emails win

## Email Copy Structure

1. **Hook** - first line grabs attention
2. **Context** - why this matters to them
3. **Value** - useful content
4. **CTA** - what to do next
5. **Sign-off** - human, warm close

**Formatting**: short paragraphs (1-3 sentences), white space, bullets for scanability, bold sparingly, mobile-first

**Length**: 50-125 words transactional, 150-300 educational, 300-500 story-driven

**CTAs**: buttons for primary, links for secondary, one clear primary per email, button text = action + outcome

## Subject Line Patterns

- Clear > clever, specific > vague
- 40-60 characters ideal
- Benefit or curiosity-driven

**Patterns that work**:
- Question: "Still struggling with X?"
- How-to: "How to [outcome] in [timeframe]"
- Number: "3 ways to [benefit]"
- Direct: "[First name], your [thing] is ready"
- Story tease: "The mistake I made with [topic]"

**Preview text**: extends subject line, ~90-140 chars, don't repeat subject
