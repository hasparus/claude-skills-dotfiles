See [references/platforms.md](references/platforms.md) for detailed platform strategies.

## Content Pillars

Build around 3-5 pillars. Example for SaaS founder:

| Pillar | % | Topics |
|--------|---|--------|
| Industry insights | 30% | Trends, data, predictions |
| Behind-the-scenes | 25% | Building the company, lessons |
| Educational | 25% | How-tos, frameworks, tips |
| Personal | 15% | Stories, values, hot takes |
| Promotional | 5% | Product updates, offers |

Per pillar: what's your unique perspective? what does audience ask? what performed well? what's sustainable? what aligns with business goals?

## Hook Formulas

First line determines if anyone reads the rest.

**Curiosity:**
- "I was wrong about [common belief]."
- "The real reason [outcome] happens isn't what you think."
- "[Impressive result] -- and it only took [short time]."

**Story:**
- "Last week, [unexpected thing] happened."
- "I almost [big mistake/failure]."
- "3 years ago, I [past state]. Today, [current state]."

**Value:**
- "How to [outcome] (without [pain]):"
- "[Number] [things] that [outcome]:"
- "Stop [common mistake]. Do this instead:"

**Contrarian:**
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold statement]"
- "[Common advice] is wrong. Here's why:"
- "I stopped [common practice] and [positive result]."

See [references/post-templates.md](references/post-templates.md) for more hooks and templates.

## Repurposing System

Blog post -> social:

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| LinkedIn | Key insight + link in comments |
| LinkedIn | Carousel of main points |
| Twitter/X | Thread of key takeaways |
| Instagram | Carousel with visuals |
| Instagram | Reel summarizing post |

Workflow: create pillar content -> extract 3-5 key insights -> adapt per platform (format + tone) -> schedule across week -> reshare evergreen content.

## Engagement Strategy

### Daily Routine (30 min)
- Respond to all comments (5 min)
- Comment on 5-10 target accounts (15 min) -- add insight, not "Great post!"
- Share/repost with added insight (5 min)
- 2-3 DMs to new connections (5 min)

### Relationship Building
- Identify 20-50 accounts in your space
- Consistently engage with their content
- Share with credit
- Collaborate eventually -- podcasts, co-created content

## Analytics

**Awareness:** impressions, reach, follower growth rate
**Engagement:** engagement rate, comments > likes, shares, saves
**Conversion:** link clicks, profile visits, DMs, leads attributed

**Low engagement?** Test new hooks, different times, different formats, increase engagement with others.
**Declining reach?** Avoid external links in post body, increase frequency, engage more in comments, test video/visual.

## Reverse Engineering Viral Content

1. Find 10-20 high-engagement creators in your niche
2. Collect 500+ posts for analysis
3. Analyze patterns -- hooks, formats, CTAs that work
4. Codify repeatable playbook
5. Layer your authentic voice
6. Bridge attention to business results
