# Competitor & Alternative Pages

## Core Principles

1. **Honesty builds trust** - acknowledge competitor strengths, be accurate about your limits
2. **Depth over surface** - go beyond feature checklists, explain *why* differences matter
3. **Help them decide** - be clear about who you're best for AND who competitor is best for
4. **Modular architecture** - centralize competitor data, single source of truth per competitor
